# üü° Ads & Marketing Materials

We offer ready-to-use marketing assets designed using real provider data to help you promote your products effectively.

**As always, please refer to our [full policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwLl0rZLreVBiPde4TOlsq1hrnaZCWmHpdVSCLRfvmo/edit?usp=sharing) on how to leverage our brand, data, etc., in marketing materials beyond the website badges, and please send us any marketing materials leveraging our brand, data, etc., for approval before publishing.**



## üìê Available Templates

The SVGs for all the badge design examples are here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EpHlBnGVikK7ymI9CGlGQJhC59y6rSNX?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-globalnav-goto)

We have 5 overlay templates for you to use with your own images.

## Best practices
- Usage Based on Achievement Level: Each badge corresponds to a specific milestone (e.g., 50+, 100+, 150+ clinicians). You may only use badges that align with the clinician achievement level you have reached.
- Add a ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù statement on image: As you can see in the example images below, there‚Äôs a smaller statement that should be added to clarify that shoppers can: ‚ÄúClick to learn more about these clinicians‚Äù or if it‚Äôs not an Ad/clickable it should say ‚ÄúVisit our website to learn more about these clinicians‚Äù ‚Äî this is to ensure transparency of the data collection process, etc.
- File Format & Scalability: Use SVG files to ensure crisp quality across all devices and screen sizes. Avoid rasterizing badges in ways that could lead to pixelation or distortion.
- Compliance & Legibility: Ensure text and logo elements within the badge remain clear and legible, even at smaller sizes. Avoid excessive overlays, drop shadows, or effects that may obscure the badge‚Äôs details.
- Badge Background Color: You may modify the badge's background color to complement the image it overlays, but the badge itself‚Äîincluding text, logos, and design elements‚Äîmust remain unchanged. Ensure sufficient color contrast for optimal readability.

### How to change the background color of the SVG

This can be done in Photoshop or Figma but if you don't have either of those tools, follow the directions below to change the color of the SVG.

- Download the preferred SVG file
- Open the SVG in your browser to preview
- Open the SVG file in a text editor, on Mac, you can use TextEdit.
- For a solid background:
   - Search for `#9E9E9E`. Change this to the desired color using the html safe name (like pink) or the hexcode.
- For a gradient background:
   - Search for `#9E9E9E`. Change that to `url(#paint0_linear_5460_93)`
   - Search for `/defs`. Add a new line above that.
   - Copy and paste the code below.
   - Change the hexcode `#9E9E9E` to the starting color of the gradient.
   - Change the hexcode `#CDCDCD` to the ending color of the gradient.
- Save and refresh the file in your browser to see the changes.
- From here you can overlay the SVG on your desired image(s) in Canva, Photoshop, Figma, etc.


Code for gradient definition:
```
<linearGradient id="paint0_linear_5460_93" x1="0" y1="116.993" x2="1080" y2="116.993" gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse"><stop stop-color="#9E9E9E"/><stop offset="1" stop-color="#CDCDCD"/></linearGradient>
```
