### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting â€“ Why Is My Badge Not Appearing on the PDP?

If your badge isn't showing up or doesn't look right, here are a few common issues and fixes:

---

#### ðŸŸ¡ **Badge Not Appearing**

- **Incorrect URL Matching**  
  Make sure all relevant request paths are included in the snippet.  
  > For example, double-check if it's `/products` vs `/product`, or `/collections/products` vs `/products`.

- **Missing or Incorrect Product Data**  
  The badge will render based on the productâ€™s `product_id`, so please ensure the correct product is associated with the appropriate ID. If you're unsure, your Solutions Engineer can help confirm this for you.

- **Delayed Script Load**  
  If the badge isnâ€™t showing up, it may be because the script is loading too late in the pageâ€™s load sequence. Try moving the script higher in the HTML, or make sure it runs once the page has fully loaded to ensure everything displays correctly.

#### ðŸŽ¨ **Styling or Spacing Issues**

- **Badge Overlapping Content**  
  Check for parent containers with `overflow: hidden` or conflicting `z-index` values.

- **Responsive Layout Conflicts**  
  Inspect how the badge behaves on mobile vs desktop. You might need to adjust margins or use media queries for optimal layout.

 - **Custom CSS**  
  While it is technically possible to override or extend our default styles using your own class targeting, we **strongly advise against making custom CSS changes**. Our current badge design is the result of extensive research and testing across dozens of health brands, and weâ€™ve optimized it specifically to maximize visibility, trust, and conversions. 

  That said, if you have a specific use case youâ€™d like to discuss, feel free to [contact our team](mailto:dev-support@frontrowmd.com).

#### ðŸ§ª **Script or Integration Errors**

- **JavaScript Not Loading**  
  Confirm the badge script URL is correct and accessible. Test in incognito or a different browser to rule out extensions or blockers.

- **Console Errors**  
  Open your browserâ€™s developer console and look for red error messages. These often point to missing data, blocked resources, or typos in configuration.
