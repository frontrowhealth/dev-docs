### **Troubleshooting - Why is my badge not appearing on the PDP?**

### Why is the spacing off?

*   **Badge Not Appearing**: Ensure the all your PDP/landing page request paths are included in the snippet. Sometimes it could be simple like “/product**s**” vs “/product” or “/collections/products” vs “/products”
    
*   **Styling Issues**: Adjust the CSS or contact our team for assistance with custom styling.
    
*   **Script Errors**: Verify the JavaScript file URL is accessible and not blocked by browser or security settings.
