## 1. Clinicians

### How do clinicians know to share our products?

It’s a two-step process:

1. **In-Clinic Visit**  
   We meet clinicians at their clinics and explain how Frontrow helps both them and their patients.

2. **Getting Started Form**  
   Once excited to join, clinicians complete a form expressing preferences:
   - Whether they’re sharing one page for the entire practice or creating individual pages
   - Product types, health issues, and brands to include/exclude
   - They have 5 days to finalize their page before it counts toward the badge (can update any time after).

---

You can add a message to your product listing, such as:

If interested, clinicians will reach out directly.

---

### Do clinicians get paid by Frontrow?

This is a **free platform** for clinicians and their patients. Clinicians are **never compensated**.

---

## 2. Discount Pages

### Do we owe a commission if a patient buys our product via a clinician page?

No.  
- You pay a **low monthly fee** for the badge.
- **Frontrow** pays the 15% cashback to patients who submit proof of purchase.

---

### How many purchases should we expect?

- Initial traffic may be low as clinician sharing ramps up.
- Patients discover discount pages from physical handouts (waiting rooms, exam rooms).
- The **main value** is **credibility** and **trust** from the medical badge.

---

### How do we know a purchase came from Frontrow?

Only when a patient:
1. Clicks through a clinician’s discount page
2. Makes a purchase
3. Submits proof of receipt to Frontrow

---

  Frontrow's engineer will walk you through it via a 15-minute screen-share call.

---

### How often does the clinician badge data update?

Every **24 hours** — fully dynamic.

---

### Can we customize the badge?

- Request other badge types by emailing the Frontrow team.

---

### How can we get clinician testimonials?

---

### Will the badge slow down my site?

No.  
- **Optimized for performance**
- **Static HTML** is served via caching

---

### Why is it critical to mention clinicians are not compensated?

- It’s the **#1 driver of trust**
- If omitted, shoppers **assume bias**
- The badge highlights that clinicians share products **without compensation**

---

### Why use the word "shared" instead of "endorsed" or "recommended"?

- “Shared” is **compliant** and **accurate**
- “Recommended” implies verbal, 1:1 endorsement which **cannot be tracked**
- “Shared” matches digital behavior (clinicians adding to their discount page)
- Builds **authenticity and trust**

---

### Why does the badge have to be sticky and duplicated?

- **Visibility**: Badges must be in natural scanning zones (image + text areas)
- **Sticky placement** boosts visibility and trust
- **Two types of badges**:
  - On product image: Award-style badge
  - In product description: Badge with trust copy

---

### Can I use the “Clinicians’ Choice” logo in other marketing?

Not on its own.  
- Must include full copy (e.g., “X clinicians shared this on FrontrowMD…”)
- Any off-website use of Frontrow data **requires approval**

---

## 4. Data

### How else can I use the data?

Wherever you'd like:  
- Email
- Social media
- Ad creatives
- B2B/investor conversations

> Just get approval from Frontrow before using data **outside the badge** to ensure compliance.

---

### How much should we expect CVR to increase?

- Depends on product and number of clinicians sharing
- Typical uplift: **~30% increase**
  - E.g., CVR from 1% → 1.3%
- Some brands have seen:
  - As little as **5%**
  - As much as **2x**
- Best way to measure: **A/B test**

---

### What data can Frontrow provide?

Available via dashboard (upon request):

- **Badge views**
- **Modal opens** (badge clicks)
- **Questions clicked** in modal
- **Clicks to clinician list**

> Must be on badge version **post 7/7/24** for full data access. Contact engineering to update if needed.

---

### Can Frontrow track conversions?

No.  
- You must use your own site tools or A/B testing platform to track conversion rates (CVR).
